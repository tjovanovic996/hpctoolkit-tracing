<p>
<tt>hpcproftt</tt>
generates textual dumps of call path profiles recorded 
by hpcrun. The profile list may contain one or more call path profiles. 
<p>
This tool principally intended for use by HPCToolkit developers rather 
than end users. Under some circumstances, a user might be interested in 
examining the raw measurement data (1) if HPCToolkit's tool chain has a problem processing 
the measurement data, or (2) if he or she is interested in inspecting 
measurements data associated with an individual instruction, which is below the 
line-level attribution reported by HPCToolkit's graphical user interfaces. 
<p>
The first section of the output describes the profile header. The profile 
header contains information including the name of the executable, its 
path, and the value of the PATH environment variable when the program was 
run, along with other metadata including the batch scheduler job id, MPI 
rank, thread ID, host ID, process ID on the host, and times when the first 
and last samples were recorded if tracing was enabled during an execution. 
<p>
The second section describes the epoch header. Conceptually, measurement 
of an execution is divided into one or more epochs in time. Measurements 
taken during an epoch are collected and flushed to disk separately. This 
section is mostly of historical interest as now hpcrun typically collects 
measurements in a single epoch. 
<p>
The third section of the profile reports the metric table. This lists 
all metrics collected during the execution of an MPI rank or thread. 
Information about a metric includes its name, type, format, and whether 
there is another partner metric. The show and showPercent fields 
indicate whether the metrics should be displayed by default in hpcviewer. 
The period field is used to scale the number of samples collected, e.g. to 
convert samples collected every 1M cache misses into cache miss counts. 
<p>
The next section of the output reports information that HPCToolkit's 
collected about the application's load map during execution. The load 
map consists of a series of pairs, where an executable or shared 
library is assigned an integer load module ID, known as an lm-id. 
Call path samples consist of a sequence of (load module ID, offset) 
pairs. Each pair represents a location in an application binary or one 
of its associated shared libraries. Load module IDs present in a call 
path profile generally correspond to load module IDs in this table. In 
certain cases, the special dummy load module ID 0 used to represent CCT 
nodes that are not associated with object code. The calling context tree 
root is an example of one of these nodes. 
<p>
The last component of the file is the Calling Context Tree (CCT). Each 
node in the tree has an ID, the ID of its parent in the tree, an 
(lm-id, lm-ip) pair that represents the load module and a relative 
instruction pointer within that load module that represents a location 
in a call path. A node in the tree may or may not have non-zero metric 
values associated with it. If a node's ID is negative, that means the 
node is a leaf in the tree. If a node's ID is odd, that means that it 
was recorded in an associated trace file and must be handled carefully 
during post-processing.
