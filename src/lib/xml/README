How to update .dtd files
-------------------------

The *.dtd files in this directory:  hpctoolkit/src/lib/xml/*.dtd.h
are automatically generated from:   hpctoolkit/lib/dtd/*.dtd

DO NOT edit the *.dtd.h files directly.  Instead, follow these steps:

1. Cd to hpctoolkit/lib/dtd/ in the source tree.

2. Edit the *.dtd files (which look like source files).

3. Run 'touch *.dtd' to make sure the time stamps in the lib/dtd/
directory are newer than the src/lib/xml/ files.  (Not strictly
necessary if you've just edited the .dtd files.)

4. Run 'make' in the top-level build directory (or in the src/lib/xml/
build directory).  This will regenerate the src/lib/xml/*.dtd.h files
in the source tree.

FIXME: We should not use 'make' to regenerate files in the source
tree.  It's too easy to make a mistake.  For example: if you did edit
the .dtd.h files directly, then make would say that the generated
files are newer than the source files and not regenerate them.  Yuck.

Instead, write a script in the lib/dtd/ directory to explicitly
regenerate the files.  Or, delete the .dtd.h files from the repository
and regenerate them on evey build.

Better still, put the source and generated files in the same
directory.
